# Clog
Console Logger, an Exercise for practical programming at HHU university

## Aim
This is not a "real" coding project, it's an exercise. Aim is to code a console logger application, that gives the user an interactive menu. It should be able to file log entries with the following fields:
- Name
- Vorname
- Wohnort
- Datum
- (Zeit)
- Titel
- Text
- Tags

The log entries can be printed by searching for specific tags, saved and read to a file.

### Object Calisthenics
The most important target for this project is to comply with Object Calisthenics, strict rules for object oriented programming. Not intended for productive usage, but as some kind of code golf. The rules are the following:

1. One level of intendation per method
2. Don't use the ELSE keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
4. First class collections
5. One dot per line
6. Don't abbreviate
7. Keep all entities small
8. No classes with more than two instance variables
9. No getters / setters / properties

In-depth-explaination on those can be found [here](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf).
